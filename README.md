# Route Planner

This project was done as part of the [Udacity Self-Driving Car Nanodegree](http://www.udacity.com/drive)

---

The goal of the project was to build a route-planning algorithm to calculate the shortest path between two points on a map.
The A* search algorithm was applied in Python using the straight-line distance to the goal as a heuristic function.
